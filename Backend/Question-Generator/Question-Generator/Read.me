# Backend – AI Question Generator

This is the **backend service** of our Final Year Project (AI Plugin for Moodle).  
It is built with **Flask** and connects to **LM Studio (LLaMA 2–7B)** to generate questions from a given topic.

---

## 🚀 Features
- REST API endpoint (`/generate-question`) for question generation
- Uses **LM Studio API** (`localhost:1234/v1/completions`) to run LLaMA locally
- Returns 5 short, difficult questions for the given topic
- Integrated with a simple frontend (HTML + JS) for testing
